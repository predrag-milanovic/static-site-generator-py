# static-site-generator-py

## About

This project is a lightweight Python static site generator (SSG) that transforms Markdown files into a deployable website. It processes content from `/content`, injects it into templates, and outputs optimized HTML to `/public`. Static assets are copied over to ensure the site is fully functional and ready for preview with a simple local server.

To serve the contents of the public directory change directories to the public directory and use Python's built-in [HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#command-line-interface):

```bash
cd public                       
python3 -m http.server 8888 &   
```

The `&` detaches the process to the background.
Run `fg` to brig it back, then `Ctrl+C`.

It breaks down each part of the pattern and explains what it does.
